# Mobile-price-

I took this data set from kaggle , it consists of 2 csv files , I used train.csv file, which has 2000 rows and 21 columns , the columns are
battery_power , blue, clock_speed, dual_sim, fc, four_g,int_memory, m_dep, mobile_wt, n_cores, pc, px_height, px_width, ram, sc_h, sc_w, talk_time, three_g, touch_screen, wifi, price_range

our target label here is price_range , we need to classify the price range of mobile phone based on the specs or features.
